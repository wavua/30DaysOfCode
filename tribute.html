  	<h1>A TRIBUTE TO WANGARI MAATHAI</h1>
  	 <h4>“It’s the little things citizens do. That’s what will make the difference. My little thing is planting trees.”</h4>

She was called “Mama Trees” by many people in Kenya. She was called a “subversive” by Kenya’s former president, Daniel Arap Moi. She helped the lives of more than 900,000 women though her economic empowerment initiatives.
She was jailed and physically beaten for fighting against the building of a skyscraper in the middle of one of the last public green spaces in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. She was recognized in 2004 as the first African woman and first environmentalist to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. She did many “little things.”</p>

<p>Wangari passed away in September 2011. Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki presided over a state funeral in Nairobi, making her only the third Kenyan and the first woman to receive such an honor. The funeral procession made its way to Uhuru Park’s Freedom Corner in downtown Nairobi, where she had stood years before protesting the possible destruction of the park and the building of a skyscraper in its place. Wangari modeled her beliefs every day. For her final action, she requested a casket made of hyacinth, papyrus, and bamboo – she still wanted to preserve the trees.</p>

<p>“In the course of history, there comes a time when humanity is called to shift to a new level of consciousness,” she said, “to reach a higher moral ground. A time when we have to shed our fear and give hope to each other. That time is now.”</p></div>
